**VOID** is a high-performance, interactive documentation archive dedicated to the C programming language. It abandons modern hand-holding to focus on the raw machine: memory, pointers, stack frames, and system architecture.

## ⚡ The Philosophy

C is not about abstraction; it is about precision. **VOID** reflects this philosophy through its design:
* **No Frameworks:** Built with 0 dependencies. Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.
* **Dark Mode Native:** A deep `#050505` aesthetic designed for late-night system programming.
* **Visual Learning:** Interactive canvas backgrounds and animated memory diagrams.

## 📚 Curriculum

The archive covers the complete system-level journey:
* **Memory:** Stack vs Heap, `malloc`, `free`, and preventing leaks.
* **Pointers:** Pointer arithmetic, `void*`, and double pointers.
* **Data Structures:** Struct padding, alignment, and unions.
* **Architecture:** Compilation stages, preprocessor macros, and build systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project implements "Awwwards-style" web techniques without heavy libraries:
* **Smooth Inertia Scroll:** Custom JavaScript implementation.
* **Reactive Canvas:** HTML5 Canvas particle network that reacts to mouse movement.
* **Fluid Typography:** Uses CSS `clamp()` for perfect scaling on any device.
* **Glassmorphism:** High-performance backdrop filters.
